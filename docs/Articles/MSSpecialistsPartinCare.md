# Specialists Play a Part in Care

Getting diagnosed with multiple sclerosis is life-changing and can require an entire village to get through. Part of this village is all the loved ones who support you. The other part is the medical team, including your physicians, all with different specialties because the disease itself causes symptoms in different areas. Some of the most common specialty physicians that people with MS use are neurologists, physical therapists, and occupational therapists. But what about the other specialty physicians we often don’t think about as options? Specialties such as a speech pathologist, a psychologist, a physiatrist, or even a dietician can all play a role in assisting the journey of MS.

## Speech pathologist

At least a third of people with MS probably experience some changes in their swallowing at some time. This is where seeing a speech pathologist would be ideal. Speech pathologists can be used when there are difficulties with swallowing, breathing, speech, or cognition. Dysphagia, the difficulty of swallowing, can occur at any point in the course of the disease. With MS, there are a multitude of issues that can come such as having weakness of your facial muscles, or losing coordination of your mouth and throat muscles. Speech pathologists
are trained to help you strengthen these muscles and build back your coordination so you can be able to smile and communicate in your daily life.

## Psychologist

One of the specialists many would not consider common with this chronic illness is a psychologist. Whether you have a village full of loved ones willing to be your caregivers or support you in any way necessary, or you are going through this journey alone, it always helps to talk things out. Although a psychologist cannot help with the physical journey your body is going through, they can help you with the emotional and mindfulness journey that will occur. Let’s face it, there are always topics we may not feel comfortable telling our loved ones or maybe sometimes, we rather just skip a difficult conversation that we know has no good outcome. It is in times like these that having a psychologist helps.

## Psychiatrist

On a physical level, MS can cause changes to your brain that can affect your mood or thinking. A psychiatrist can help with medical treatment of MS-induced depression, anxiety, or other mental health changes. A neuro psychiatrist can diagnose cognitive changes and provide strategies to help maintain cognitive function.

## Physiatrist

If I say physiatrist, what is the first thing you think of? If you’re like me, you either think I spelled psychiatrist wrong, or you think “I have never heard this word before.” Well, a physiatrist is a physician who takes the primary role in diagnosing and managing your musculoskeletal issues. The difference between a physiatrist and a physical therapist is that the physical therapist is the one who performs the therapy. When dealing with musculoskeletal issues, such as weakness of your muscles or gait issues, your physiatrist works with you and helps to check your progress in physical therapy. The need for a physiatrist is entirely your decision. Some people go to physical therapy based on a referral from their primary care physicians and others may want to see a physiatrist, so they have a more specialized physician working alongside their treatment for muscle issues with them.

## Dietician

With so many dietary options and opinions available on the Internet, it can become over whelming to know which type of diet should
be followed. Diets, such as the Wahls Diet, the Swank Diet, or the Mediterreanean diet are often recommended for those with MS, while some people believe they need a less strict regimen and may want to avoid only certain foods or food groups. The trial-and-error method of different diets and following the many varying recipes available online may work for some, but seeing a dietician could help speed up the process. Dietitians are trained to help you identify foods that can help your body feel better and cause less fatigue. They can help you figure out ways to prepare meals that work with your schedule and with your ability to use the kitchen as well. The additional bonus to this specialty is that they can also help with swallowing problems.

With all these different specialists available, it is worth seeing what can be done to improve your health and function. It is very important to continue with the healthcare team you have created, whether that be a primary physician, a neurologist, a physical therapist, or all of them together. Whether you are just starting your journey or have been facing the consequences of MS for a while now, it can be helpful to explore different specialties that are often overlooked.

# Where are you Traveling Next?

For some, the thought of traveling might be anxiety-provoking. So much so, that you’d rather sit at home and maybe try some other day. One of the hardest parts of traveling is the initial planning. This should be an exciting time filled with enthusiasm rather than anxiety. So, where do you start this planning process? Let’s pick a location first and then the remainder of the planning should be an easy transition.

## Cruises and parks to consider

**Cruises:** Cruises are one of the best options. You don’t have to pack and unpack throughout your trip. Once you are on the cruise, for however many days, you don’t have to settle in again. This is your destination, and you can enjoy the amenities the cruise ship has to offer. There is always a physician on board, in case of emergencies. If you are having a physically tough day, you can stay on the ship. If you are feeling adventurous, you can step off of the ship and explore until you feel you need to rest again.

**National parks:** One of the benefits of national parks is they were designed to be accessible for all. Many parks have paved pathways and accessible ramps in case you are using a wheelchair. Some parks also have different routes based on difficulty. Depending on how you feel, you can decide which level of difficulty in the varied routes your body wants to take. You can also camp at national parks, have picnics, or rent an RV so you have a comfortable surrounding with air conditioning in case you need to take breaks. There are many options available to enjoy the scenic views of national and even state parks.

**Disney theme parks:** Though this option may seem far-fetched, it is surprisingly doable. Disney prides itself on being accessible for all ages and people. This also means anyone with a disability or needing some extra assistance to enjoy the rides and adventures. Disney offers a pass called the disability access service. The DAS pass allows you to skip the long lines in the hot sun and enjoy the rides you’d like to explore. They also have electronic conveyance vehicle rentals for those who have difficulty walking through the parks and offer wheelchair rentals as well. State parks, theme parks, national parks, and cruises are only some of the many options available for your next travel destination. If you feel you want to travel to a specific state for some sightseeing instead, there are some factors to take into consideration.

## Traveling based on your symptons

If one of your most frequent symptoms is heat intolerance, be mindful of the season you are traveling in. Canada’s Banff National Park is a place to consider if you like cooler weather. The park offers a variety of sights and has accessible lodging nearby. If your symptom experience is more commonly fatigue, perhaps you want to consider major cities so you can see pieces of it and have time to rest throughout the day. You can start with smaller major cities such as downtown Houston or Atlanta, and slowly make your way to the more densely populated ones such as New York or Seattle.

For some, mobility is the largest roadblock when considering where to travel. If this is your case, perhaps traveling somewhere that has open roads and less population could help you in moving within the city. You can start small with road trips in your local state. If you live in Florida, perhaps drive down to the Florida Keys and enjoy the beach (including the beach wheelchairs available in state parks) and local restaurants.

Every state has special gems awaiting to be explored. Traveling can seem scary at first, but remember, it’s all about planning. So plan your next trip now and get ready to start your venture.

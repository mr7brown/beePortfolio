# Making Fall Feasting Enjoyable

Fall is the time to watch the leaves change colors, feel the cool crisp air, and to start thinking about all the warm home-cooked meals filled with differently spiced aromas. For some, it is the time to start planning which different meals to cook during the gatherings they will be hosting. For others, it is the time to start thinking and planning which events they will be attending or politely declining.

During this season, we always tend to think of food. Pumpkin-filled food, food filled with warm spices such as cinnamon, and all the variety of pies imaginable. While all these meals sound delicious and give us a feeling of home, they also come with a heavy price of sugar and carbohydrates. It can be challenging to navigate the festivities fall has to offer while still maintaining your diet plan. This challenge can come in different forms, whether it be declining an invite because you do not want to disclose your multiple sclerosis to random strangers; or because you do not know how to decline some, or possibly all, of the meals that will be cooked by the host. Here are some tips from those who have successfully figured out the process of going to gatherings while remaining true to yourself and your dietary choices.

Rebecca Munlyn, of Georgia, follows the Wahl’s Protocol Diet. She believes this diet plan, filled with consumption of meat, fish,
and vegetables, and restrictive of carbohydrates, sugars, and dairy products, has helped her with her MS symptoms. Her advice is to offer bringing a dish of your own from home so the host may feel that you are contributing, but you are also bringing something to a gathering that you are comfortable eating.

“You can also substitute some of the famous holiday meals to match your dietary restrictions, such as eating cauliflower mac and cheese instead of the grained version of mac and cheese.” According to Rebecca, it is important to listen to your body throughout the process, and if you crave a dessert, then it is okay to take a small bite so you can fulfill that craving. Everything should be done in moderation.

The other piece of advice Rebecca offers to those trying to navigate this fall season is “to educate the people in your lives about your disease.” It is important that you feel safe and welcomed in the environment where you are going to be sharing meals and feeling the seasonal joy. Educating those around you allows the people with whom you are sharing a meal to understand your disease through your perception.

## Managing sugar, energy levels

Delaware resident Cynthia Hall shared her tips for getting through the fall season. Her diet consists mostly of organic vegan food. She tries to fill her table with as many vegetables as possible, but will also host gatherings where she will cook the traditional turkey for her guests. She also tries to moderate the desserts served during the fall season. As for the sweet portion of the meal, she said, “desserts will have far less sugar in them, for me, than the conventional American desserts we see. Much of the sweetness may come from stevia, as I prepare them so people can enjoy them, but I can also take a few bites.”

The part of the fall holiday that Cynthia said is the most challenging is how to manage her energy levels while still being able to attend gatherings. She said “the truth is I’m unable to attend every social event during the holidays that I would like to. And I would prefer to be invited to a friend or family member's home for meals for which I will contribute side dishes and desserts (so I do not need to expend energy cleaning my house in addition to cooking).” Having to balance her energy while still seeing loved ones is a task Cynthia has become successful at.

We all know fall to be the time we get excited to see all our loved ones sitting at the table and eating home cooked meals. It is the time to laugh and look forward to gatherings. With these tips in mind, the season can be more enjoyable for you as well.

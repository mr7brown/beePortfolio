# Welcome to Bhavya's Portfolio

With a strong background in medical writing and research, I have successfully contributed to publications, including research articles, educational materials, and clinical studies, all resulting in increased visibility for organizations and foundations. My skills encompass learning module development, grant writing, and project management, allowing me to provide comprehensive support throughout the publication process. With an in-depth knowledge of regulatory affairs, clinical trial protocols, and medical terminology, I am committed to delivering high-quality, accurate, and impactful scientific content.

This portfolio contains examples of content I've developed over the past decade. To navigate the site, either use the sidebar navigation or the tags below to be directed to samples grouped by category.

<!-- ## Site Navigation

1. The `sidebar` provides a user experience similar to many leading developer documentation portals.
2. Alternatively, tool-specific docs can be found by using the search component in th `navbar` or by clicking on one of the `Tags` below or at the end of each doc. -->

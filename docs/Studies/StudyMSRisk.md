# Study IDs key factor that shapes MS risk

Scientists have discovered a key determinant of the risk for multiple sclerosis, advancing efforts to prevent and better treat the disease. These new insights into how the immune system functions, or should function, help doctors and scientists better understand the underlying causes of MS and give them attractive targets in their efforts to develop new treatments and preventive measures.

Researchers at the University of Virginia School of Medicine’s Department of Microbiology, Immunology and Cancer Biology identified a series of processes in cells that suppresses the risk for developing MS. At the head of these processes is a gene that acts as a master controller for many other genes important in our susceptibility to MS and in the proper functioning of our immune systems.

The researchers conclude the master gene, DDX39B, is an important guardian of immune tolerance. This means it helps keep the body’s immune response working at the appropriate levels, so the immune system doesn’t begin to attack the body’s own cells – as is the case in MS. The study’s authors note that in cases of autoimmune diseases, they would want to activate DDX39B with small-molecule agonists, for which there is strong preclinical precedent.

This master gene directs the activity of another gene critical in the production of important immune cells called T regulatory cells previously linked to MS. This second gene, FOXP3, is already known to play a critical role in autoimmune disorders. Researchers believe that basic understanding of molecular mechanisms underpinning immune tolerance will open paths to truly targeted therapy.

Findings were published in the scientific journal eLife.

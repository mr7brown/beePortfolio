## Abstract

With the increased prevalence of Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), there has been a concomitant increase in researching standard clinical practices for the illness in hopes of acquiring more effective treatments. One innovative way to ascertain the efficacy of a treatment plan is to use “digital epidemiology”. This practice utilizes the growing amount of data and information available at society’s fingertips and uses it to understand the patterns of disease and health dynamics in populations as well as the causes of these patterns and to use this understanding to mitigate and prevent disease, and to promote health. With Google dominating the search engine market since its inception in 1998, it has become the primary vehicle for many to obtain information about a condition, the treatments used, and their side effects. Through Google Trends and the five selected terms, we obtained data to compare to the annual prescription count to analyze consumer consumption of the two main drugs that were being used to treat GERD, Omeprazole, and Ranitidine. With the usage of Google Trends, we can see how the ease of access to information has altered the intake of medications and influenced consumers to self-diagnose and treat. By comparing Google Trends with the prescription count of Omeprazole and Ranitidine in the population of this country in the past 10 years, we illustrated a strong correlation between the usage of Google and the script count of the two medications. The influence of the media can be a factor that alters consumption, i.e. the recall of Zantac that occurred in the fall of 2019. Google Trends holds value as an observation tool for consumer utilization but it is important to note that its predictive characteristics can be influenced by the media. This paper focuses on the effectiveness of Google Trends as a predictive tool while discussing some of the shortcomings that may come about when using the search engine as an epidemiological instrument.

## Introduction

Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is the abnormal movement of gastric contents into the esophagus and their associated sequela. Symptoms can include heartburn, indigestion, regurgitation and lead to complications such as esophagitis, esophageal stricture, and Barrett’s esophagus. GERD is one of the most common diseases in the Western world, with a prevalence of approximately 20% in adults. According to the American College of Gastroenterology, an estimated 60 million Americans at least once a month and 15 million people daily are affected by heartburn3. It is speculated that the incidence of GERD has remained steady partly due to the ease of access to information online and the ease of purchasing medications. Replace with: The prevalence of GERD is found to be consistently increasing by an estimated 4% per year in parallel with increasing obesity rates.

Common over-the-counter drugs used for GERD are Proton Pump Inhibitors (PPIs), H2-blockers, and/or antacids such as Calcium Carbonate (Tums), and Sodium Alginate (Gaviscon). The market size for these pharmaceutical treatments was estimated at USD 4.8 billion in 2019 and is expected to reach USD 4.6 billion in 2020. Though these medications are readily available, they only manage the symptoms of GERD; they do not address the actual cause of the disease, which is the movement of contents into the esophagus. Nonetheless, people do consume these medications to alleviate symptoms because they have been told by either their physician, their friend/family member or the media that these medications will help.

By using the Google search bar, people have been able to obtain answers to physician-related questions such as information on the disease, treatments for these diseases i.e. medications, and/or medically related advice. Google's total daily health-related searches amount to 70,000 each minute. According to the National Institutes of Health, more than a third of adults in the U.S. turn to the Internet to self-diagnose ailments by using online tools and resources like digital symptom checkers and health information sites like WebMD. When searching for pharmaceutical treatments, people were being directed to reputable websites following their initial search input about a prescription-only medicine. With the prevalence of GERD and the increased use of online searches for medical conditions and respective treatments, we sought to examine Google Trends to see how searches for GERD and subsequent treatments have changed over time.

## Objectives

1. To utilize Google Trends to understand the change in consumer preference over time regarding antacid use.
2. To compare consumer search for an H2 blocker, such as ranitidine, to a Proton Pump Inhibitor (Omeprazole).

## Methodology

We studied how the number of Ranitidine and Omeprazole prescriptions in the United States changed over time, and how these changes were reflected in the online activity of the population using Google as a search tool. We obtained the actual number of patients that have received Ranitidine and Omeprazole prescriptions for the treatment of Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD) by accessing ClinCalc, a clinical drug statistic database, within the 2009-2019 timeline. We obtained data on the number of Google searches made for the five terms: Ranitidine, Omeprazole, GERD, PPI Side Effects, and Zantac Recall from the website Google Trends (trends.google.com). The number of queries for a given term is rescaled to a value between 0 and 100. To mitigate this issue, the Google trends data was run through a database called Keywords Everywhere. This database converts the scaled numbers of Google Trends into actual numbers. To investigate whether data from Google can help us to estimate the consumption of GERD medications, we follow the findings of the clinical medication database seen in Figure 1 for Ranitidine and Omeprazole. We analyzed data on Google trends for the five terms listed above. Prescription counts for Ranitidine were estimated by taking the rate of change from previous years, which averaged 1.1% annually. Figure 2 depicts the Google Trends of the five terms for the past 10 years.

## Results

Five keywords were searched in Google Trends and data was compounded from 2009 to 2019. Keywords generally increased in search popularity over the time span coinciding with the FDA’s announcement of the recall of the popular proton pump inhibitor drug, Zantac. Correlation coefficients were calculated between each keyword and the U.S. prescription rates of Ranitidine (Zantac) and Omeprazole to determine the correlation of consumption of these drugs versus the search trends used.

When looking at the data, keyword correlations ranged from R=0.04 (zantac recall) to R=0.60 (omeprazole). Among the five keywords analyzed from Google Trends, GERD, ranitidine, and omeprazole had the strongest correlations when compared to the prescription rates of Ranitidine in the U.S. as a whole, with R values of 0.58, 0.52, and 0.60, respectively. 2 of the 5 keywords had weak positive correlations (R=0.04 to 0.26) when compared to Ranitidine prescription rates in the U.S. from 2009-2019, while 4 of the 5 keywords had weak positive correlations when compared to Omeprazole prescription rates in the U.S. for the same timeline (R=0.17 to .38). 1 out of the 5 keywords (zantac recall) had a weak negative correlation when compared to Omeprazole prescription rates in the United States at (-0.1149). All five search queries had a p-value <.00001 and exhibited a positive clinical significance.

## Discussion

Proton pump inhibitors are the most common class of drugs being prescribed in today’s market to treat the symptoms of Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease. Their use is increasing, in particular for long-term treatment, often being over-prescribed and used for inappropriate conditions. The adverse effects of proton pump inhibitors are greatest for Omeprazole, which has been on the market the longest. There have been case reports of sexual disturbances, gynecomastia, gout, lethargy, polyarthralgia, campylobacter gastroenteritis, atrophic gastritis, angioedema, subacute myopathy, and ocular damage. The usage of Omeprazole has increased since 2019 due to the recall of Ranitidine (Brand name: Zantac). The drug was recalled on September 13, 2019, because a Connecticut-based online pharmacy [informed] the FDA that it had detected NDMA [N-nitrosodimethylamine] in multiple ranitidine products under certain test conditions. NDMA poses as a human carcinogen that could affect the long-term health of those who consume the drug. This recall has altered the consumption of other alternatives that can also be found over-the-counter to alleviate symptoms of GERD, such as Proton Pump Inhibitors.

We found that all five terms followed a very similar pattern in time when compared to the corresponding prescription numbers, showing a significance of (p< .00001). There was also a positive correlation for all the terms except ‘Zantac Recall’ when compared to Omeprazole prescriptions with an (r = -0.117). The positive correlation observed between the search queries and drug prescription rates indicates that as the public was informed of Zantac being recalled, consumer behavior skewed toward an increase in Ranitidine and Omeprazole consumption.
The data used reflects the 2009-2018 timeline and the Zantac/Ranitidine recall occurred in the Fall of 2019. The 2019 data was not available at the time of analysis and were imputed using the previous year's data and the Google trend using the terms stated above. It is expected that the consumption trend would be different during 2019, as providers were made aware of the Zantac recall and changed their prescription habits. We may see a lag in the Google Trend Search vs the data trend due to the communication between FDA and the physicians prescribing Zantac. Google Trends showed clinical significance for all five trending terms mentioned in estimating consumer consumption for Ranitidine and Omeprazole prescriptions in the United States for the 10-year time period (Fig. 2). Ranitidine and Omeprazole prescription rates also showed a positive correlation with the search volume for the five search queries with the exception of the term “Zantac Recall.”

Though Google Trends may not provide precise data, it has modest reliability for defining the epidemiology of relatively common diseases. The limitations set in this study were due to the inaccessibility of obtaining data sets for Ranitidine for 2019. The data for 2019 was unattainable at the time due to its lack of availability but when present, would create more concrete data points for analysis since Fall 2019 is the time period of the Ranitidine recall. Furthermore, this study was solely performed using Google Trends and CliniCal, therefore no real-time surveys could be performed to obtain data in which we ask a general population about their consumption of the various treatments for GERD. Since GERD is a prevalent disease, changes to the population burden of chronic GI symptoms may be tracked by monitoring changes to the Google search engine query volume over time.

The use of Google Trends simply allows us to acquire a value in which we are able to track the trend of certain terms. The usage of Google as a search engine has increased significantly in the past ten years as a tool to answer questions that commonly could be not answered with a simple computer. Figure 6 displays the increased usage of Google as a search engine versus its competitors. One of the limitations set by using Google Trends as a tool to obtain data is the possibility of the media influencing the trends. As we see, the trend for terms specifically related to Ranitidine and its recall increased during the time of the media emphasizing the recall. It should be taken into consideration that the data points of Google can be altered based on the media. There are many other terms that can be associated with the control of this study, Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease. The purpose of using the five terms listed above is to display the strong correlation between the consumption of Omeprazole and Ranitidine versus the search trends used. Google Trends holds merit as a surveillance tool for customer consumption but its predictive quality is skewed by the current frequency that social media advertises popular GERD treatments to the same target audience.

There are many other factors that can alter trending data, such as the recall of Zantac in 2019 that correlated with a peak in queries for Ranitidine. The study found that in the end, there is a significant correlation between Ranitidine and Omeprazole prescription rates and the corresponding increase in related Google Trend queries.

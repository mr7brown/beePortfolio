# Gene networks point to MS dampening effect during pregnancy

Women with multiple sclerosis temporarily get better when pregnant. A new study has identified the beneficial changes naturally occurring in the immune system during pregnancy. The findings may show the way to new treatments.

In MS, nerve function is hampered because the immune system attacks the fat that serves as an insulating sheath around the nerve fibers. The nerves become inflamed, which could lead to nerve damage.

Pregnancy is a very special condition from an immunological point of view. The immune system defends against foreign substances. Although half of the genetic material of the fetus comes from the father, it is not rejected by the mother’s immune system. One reason is that during pregnancy the mother’s immune system becomes more tolerant.

Periods of symptoms (i.e. relapses) decrease by 70 percent during the last third of pregnancy. But the reason for this has not been clear. Researchers at the Department of Biomedical and Clinical Sciences at Linköping University, in Sweden, wanted to know what mechanisms could be important for the decrease in symptoms during pregnancy, as a step towards future treatment strategies. The study compared 11 women with MS to seven healthy women who had blood samples taken before, during, and after pregnancy.

Researchers were particularly interested in T cells, which play an important role in the immune system. They help drive MS and are important during pregnancy. To understand what happens in the immune cells, the researchers identified the genes used in the T cells at various points in time during pregnancy. They also studied changes regulating how genes are switched on and off. The researchers looked specifically at one such regulation mechanism called DNA methylation.

They discovered networks of interacting genes that are affected during pregnancy. Their findings suggest these genes are to a large extent linked to MS and to important processes in the immune system. The network of genes affected during pregnancy also included those regulated by pregnancy hormones, mainly progesterone.

The researchers are now testing various hormones in the lab in an attempt to mimic the effects observed in the study, to see if these can be part of a possible future treatment strategy.
